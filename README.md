# Placement Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Description

This project uses **logistic regression** to predict whether a student will get placed based on a variety of academic, technical, and personal performance indicators. The target variable is "Placement" (encoded as `Yes= 1`, `No = 0`), and the goal is to identify which features most influence placement outcomes.

The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of logistic regression coefficients.



## Features Used

- CGPA  
- Projects Completed  
- Communication Skills  
- Previous Semester Result  
- IQ  
- Internship Experience  
- Extra Curricular Score  
- Academic Performance



## Key Findings

-"CGPA"is the most significant factor positively influencing placement.
- "Projects Completed" and "Communication Skills" also have strong positive impacts.
- "Internship Experience" has a moderate positive effect, indicating practical exposure is beneficial.
- Features like "Extra Curricular Score" and "Academic Performance" show very small or slightly negative coefficients, possibly due to redundancy or low influence.



##  Tech Stack

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib / seaborn (optional for visualization)



## Conclusion

The results emphasize that students aiming for better placement outcomes should focus on:
- Maintaining a strong "CGPA"
- Completing relevant "technical projects"
- Building strong "communication skills"
- Gaining "internship experience"

This analysis demonstrates how logistic regression can provide not only predictions but also interpretability in understanding what drives placement decisions.
