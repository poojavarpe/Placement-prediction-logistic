# Placement-prediction-logistic
This project aims to predict whether a student will get placed or not using Logistic Regression, based on various academic, technical, and personal attributes. The target variable is binary â€” Placement (Yes = 1, No = 0). The model evaluates how each feature contributes to placement outcomes by analyzing the logistic regression coefficients.
